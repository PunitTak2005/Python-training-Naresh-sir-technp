# File handling operations

# 1. Writing to a file
def write_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, "w") as file:  # "w" mode opens the file for writing, creates it if it doesn't exist
        file.write(content)
        print(f"Content written to {filename}")

# 2. Reading from a file
def read_from_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as file:  # "r" mode opens the file for reading
            content = file.read()
            print(f"Content of {filename}:\n{content}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"{filename} not found!")

# 3. Appending to a file
def append_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, "a") as file:  # "a" mode opens the file for appending
        file.write(content)
        print(f"Content appended to {filename}")

# Example usage:
filename = "example.txt"

# Write to the file
write_to_file(filename, "Hello, this is the first line.\n")

# Append to the file
append_to_file(filename, "This is an additional line.\n")

# Read from the file
read_from_file(filename)
